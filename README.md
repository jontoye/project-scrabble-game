# Scrabble 
A digital version of the classic board game where players take turns building words with their tiles, trying to score the most possible points.

## Getting Started
To begin the game, players must enter their names and select their player icon from the main screen. If no information is submitted the default player names become 'Player 1, Player 2, etc.'<br>

The first player of the game must use the center square on the board for their first word. Each player after this must connect their tiles to the tiles already placed on the board.<br>

Scoring is based on each tiles' point value as well as where it was placed on the board. Certain squares will award bonus points. A player can score points for more than one word each turn, as long as all tile placements are valid. Once a valid word is played, players draw new random tiles from the bag to refill their rack.<br>

The game ends when any player runs out of tiles. The point value of all remaining unused tiles is added up and awarded to the player who ended the game. The winner is the player who has the highest total point value.<br>
